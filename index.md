# About me

Hi! My name is Derek Lilienthal, and I am nearing completion of my Master's in Artificial Intelligence at San Jose State University, where I am finalizing my thesis on using conditional generative models for data augmentation in recommendation systems to increase group fairness. Prior to this, I completed my Bachelor's in Computer Science, concentrating in Data Science and minoring in Statistics, at CSU Monterey Bay.

# Current Position

I am working as a **Research Computing Intern** for the **Pacific Northwest National Laboratory** ([PNNL](https://www.pnnl.gov/)), where I am working on containerizing machine learning workflows through PNNL's High-Performance Computing (HPC) clusters. My work will enable the thousands of researchers who utilize the HPC to have reliable and reproducible results without worrying about the nuances of creating a code optimized for distributed parallelization on RedHat Linux.
